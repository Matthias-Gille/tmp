#Headline 1  
##HEadline 2  

After the first weeks with git we made a small recap because we encountered some problems and had some open questions. You can find the learnings and descisions we made in this guide. 

If you need more information in general regarding the usage of git you might want to check the great video course called "Version control for designers" that we found. The course was done by Adria Jimenez, a XING engineer/designer from Barcelona. You can find a link at the bottom of the page.

## Organizations (Teams)

Each UX team should have an own team space inside our XING enterprise account. In GitHub these spaces are called organizations. You can create one in your settings section (top right corner) under: settings > organizations.  

It would be best to give someone specific the owner status of the organization and everyone else in the team member status. You can do this under: organizations > xxx

### Naming for our organizations

We decided that it is best, to name all organisations with the prefix "UX-" so they can be found easier inside GitHub.

UX-Mobile  
UX-Content  
UX-Premium  
UX-Growth  
UX-White  
etc..  

## Repositories (Projects)

When you plan your repositories/projects inside GitHub think about three things: 

### Repositories can either be visible or not visible for everyone else  
It is not possible to hide a subfolder from someone. So best would be to create specific private repos for administration stuff. You can check the status everytime under: Settings > xxx

### Respositories can only be cloned completely  
It is not possible to clone (save) subfolders to your computer. Therefore you need a clever logic since your harddrive space is limited. Best would be to create repos for every big project and combine the rest in a repo for daily jobs. You can also set up archive repos. But again these archive repos should be set up for each year individually so they don't get too big.  

### Whatever was uploaded to a repository will stay there forever  
If you upload 500MB of material when you start a project and delete it when the project is done, it will stay there inside the history. GitHub keeps those files in case you might want to return to a previous state of your project later. Keep this in mind and always only upload, what is important for the project or for others. Also try to keep your sketch & photoshop files as small as possible. Don't import hi-res 70MB images, when you just need a 960x320px visual.  

### Naming of our repositories
We can assume that many teams will have similar repos. For example nearly every team will have a repository called "iOS". To avoid confusion we decided that it is best to use the organization name as a prefix:  

UX-Mobile-iOS  
UX-Content-iOS  
UX-Premium-iOS  
UX-Growth-iOS  
UX-White-iOS  
etc..
